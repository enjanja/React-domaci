                text="The word Satan was not originally a proper name but rather an ordinary noun meaning the adversary  in this context, it appears at several points in the Old Testament. For instance, in the Book of Samuel, David is presented as the satan (adversary) of the Philistines, while in the Book of Numbers the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to satan (to oppose) Balaam. Prior to the composition of the New Testament, the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebelled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the Book of Enoch. This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit sin; in the Book of Matthew and the Book of Luke, he attempted to tempt Jesus of Nazareth as the latter fasted in the wilderness.
                
                The word Satanism was adopted into English from the French satanisme. The terms Satanism and Satanist are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups. In a Roman Catholic tract of 1565, the author condemns the heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes of the Protestants. In an Anglican work of 1559, Anabaptists and other Protestant sects are condemned as swarmes of Satanistes. As used in this manner, the term Satanism was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather, it claimed that the accused was deviating from true Christianity, and thus serving the will of Satan.  During the nineteenth century, the term Satanism began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle, and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan. This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the Swedish language; the Lutheran Bishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as Sathanister in his Ethica Christiana, produced between 1615 and 1630."
