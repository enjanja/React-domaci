                text="In their study of Satanism, the religious studies scholars AsbjÃ¸rn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen stated that the term Satanism has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for 'othering'. The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from Christian mythology.

                Elsewhere, Petersen noted that Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation. Eugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, Satanism was usually a polemical, not a descriptive term.
                Historical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society. This commonly involves a belief in witches, a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in incest, murder, and cannibalism. Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society. For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms, to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals, or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems."
                
                footer="In 1994, the Italian sociologist Massimo Introvigne suggested defining Satanism with the simultaneous presence of 1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices. The definition applies regardless of the way in which each group perceives Satan- as personal or impersonal, real or symbolic."
